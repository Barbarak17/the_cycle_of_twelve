# the_cycle_of_twelve

Sand mouse cells have a circadian oscillator that depends (in part) on transcriptional regulation. 
The mRNA expression levels of twelve sand mouse genes are known to vary cyclically in a 24 hour period, in different phases. 
However, their phases relative to each other remain unknown. The phase information is critical. 
If the 12 phases were known, then the 12 genes could be ordered into a relative order of activation. 
This would make testable predictions about which gene products are most likely to be ‘upstream’ in the regulatory pathway and directly regulating transcription of which ‘downstream’ genes.

Goal: compare two experiments with different reliabilities ( +-20, +-2, and +-5).
Solve by maximum likelihood and provide visuals.
